# Introduction

### Sometimes we experience problem of existing black box. For example, weakness of side part (hit and run), memory lack (it always on), doesnâ€™t detect tiny vibration. So, we design new black box type in order to compensate the defect of existing black box.
We implement application that detects collision direction/intensity/time, takes a photo and send it to cellphone. We use arduino board, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor and it connect with eCube board. And eCube board communicate with android using WiFi.
